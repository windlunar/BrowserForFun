        <p>Earth</p> 
        <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. About 29% of</p> 
        <p>Earth's surface is land consisting of continents and islands. The remaining 71% is covered with water, mostly</p> 
        <p>by oceans but also lakes, rivers and other fresh water, which together constitute the hydrosphere.</p>

        <p>Much of Earth's polar regions are covered in ice. Earth's outer layer is divided into several rigid tectonic</p> 
        <p>plates that migrate across the surface over many millions of years. Earth's interior remains active with a</p> 
        <img src=./temp/solar.jpg>
        <p>solid iron inner core, a liquid outer core that generates Earth's magnetic field, and a convecting mantle that</p> 
        <p>drives plate tectonics.
