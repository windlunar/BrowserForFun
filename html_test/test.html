        <p>C (programming language)(From Wiki)</p>
        <p>C is a general-purpose, procedural computer</p>
        <p>programming language supporting structured programming, lexical variable</p> 
        <p>scope, and recursion, with a static type system. By design, C provides</p> 
        <p>constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions. It has</p> 
        <p>found lasting use in applications previously coded in assembly language.</p> 
        <p>Such applications include operating systems and various application</p> 
        <p>software for computer architectures that range from supercomputers to</p> 
        <p>PLCs and embedded systems.</p> 
        <p>A successor to the programming language B, C was originally developed at Bell Labs</p>
        <p>by Dennis Ritchie between 1972 and 1973 to construct utilities running on Unix.</p> 
        <p>It was applied to re-implementing the kernel of the Unix operating system.[6]</p> 
        <p>During the 1980s, C gradually gained popularity. It has become one of the most</p> 
        <p>widely used programming languages,[7][8] with C compilers from various vendors</p> 
        <p>available for the majority of existing computer architectures and operating</p> 
        <p>systems. C has been standardized by the ANSI since 1989 (ANSI C) and by the</p> 
        <p>International Organization for Standardization (ISO). As of September 2020,</p> 
        <p>C is the most popular programming language.</p>
